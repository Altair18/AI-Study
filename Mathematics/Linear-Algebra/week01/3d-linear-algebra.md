What I learnt:
A 3d Linear transformation maps vectors in 3d space using a 3x3 matrix. Each column corresponds with the basis vectors, for example: first column = i-hat, second column = j-hat, third vector = k-hat
The basis vectors for each are: (i -> (1,0,0) j -> (0,1,0) k -> (0,0,1). Transformation refers to scaling and summing its basis by applying a matrix.
