What I learned / my notes:

Transformation is something that take input and gives output for each one. In Linear Algebra, transformation take in a vector and give another vector

In Linear transformation, grid lines are parallel and evenly spaced and it's a rule which moves vectors in space in a consistent and structured way.
A grid is no longer linear if the starting point moves or if lines bend into curves

A matrix is just the record of what happens to the two most basic vectors: i-hat = [1,0] and j-hat = [0,1] <- if I know where those two go,  can figure out where any vector goes
All vectors are just a combinations of those two vectors.

For example: if v = -2 * i-hat + 2 * j-hat and the transformation sends i-hat = [1,-2] j-hat = [3,0], then: v = -2 * [1,-2] + 2 * [3,0] = [4,4]
shear is a transformation where i-hat remains fixed = [1,0], and j-hat = [1,1]
If vectors that i-hat and j-hat land on are linearly dependant, for example: i-hat = [2,1], j-hat = [-2,1], this would make the linear transformation squish all of 2d space onto a single line
