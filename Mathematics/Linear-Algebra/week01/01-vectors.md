What I Learned:

- Vectors can be visual (arrows) or an abstract list of numbers and both interpretations are valiid.
- Understanding vector addition and scalar multiplication is central to everything in algebra.
- Coordinates of a vector are a pair of numbers that give instructions on how to get from the tail of that vector to the tip of that vector
- in x-axis, positive values indicate a rightward motion whilst negative values represent a leftward motion, and in y-axis positive values represent upward movement whilst negatvie values represent a downwards movement.
- vector that corresponds to going down 4 units and 7 units to the right can be seen as (7,-4)
- vector addition - It's the process of adding two vectors to get a destination vector. I like to do it by adding the top value (x-axis) and then bottom value (y-axis) to get answer. E,g: [3,4] + [-1, 2] = [2,6]
We can also match their terms and add them together like so:

Scaling refers to multiplying / doing calculations on every component of the vector by the scalar.
