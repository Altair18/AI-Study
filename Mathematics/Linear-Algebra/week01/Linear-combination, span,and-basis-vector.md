What I learned:

There is another way to think about vectors which is central to linear algebra. When having pair of numbers meant to describe a vector (like [3,-1] I can think of each coordinate as a scalar.
Scalar as in think about how each vector stretches or squishes.
In xy system there are two special vectors, one pointing to the right called i hat and one point straight up called j hat, each has a length of 1.

basis is the combination of the i hat and j hat coordinate system, the basis vector is what those scalars actually scale.

A linear combination is when you scale vectors (stretch/shrink them) and then add them.

Think: a * v + b * w You're turning knobs a and b to scale vectors v and w, then summing the result.

the span of two vectors is the collection of all vectors you can build using them in linear combination. If the vectors are not lined up, their span is the whole 2d and if they do line up then they're limited to a line.
if you combine a 3rd vector into the equation now we have a 3d space.

Basis Vectors:
Every coordinate used is just saying Scale i hat by this much and j hat by that much.
Vectors are linear independant if no other vectors can be built using the other vectors and they're dependant if one can be built from the others (one isn't redudant and one is)
