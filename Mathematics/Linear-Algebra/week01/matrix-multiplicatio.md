Notes / Learned:
A composition is when you apply two functions in a row and in algebra terms, it means applying one matrix and then another, and the result is the new transformation
composition result = B matrix x A matrix (reading from right to left)

Matrix multiplication is column-by-column and each column represents where the basis vectors land
Associative means doesn't matter where the parenthesis were placed, the end result is the same
