Scale Drives Deep Progess

- Performance of neural networks depends on both amount of data and also the size of the network

- Sigmoid for probabilities, ReLU for faster, more efficient learning

- Training Process: Forward Propagation - make predictions. Backward Propagation - updates weights using gradients
